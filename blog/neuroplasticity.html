      Thinking of the brain as a muscle, when you train it, it strengthens and grows. Much like muscles. With the power of imagination and action, by combining these two concepts we can achieve goals that we imagine to do, by imagining; it strengthens our ability to when we put our goals to action. It requires attention in both sections of these concepts. For example, imagine learning piano, having a mental picture in your mind of the keys and your fingers playing chords. When we come to do the physical action of this we will probably find it easier and somewhat  comfortable to play the piano.  This is the hypothetical theory of Neuroplasticity. Though studies show that it works. You have to be willing to put action into imagination.

      <h2>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people: </h2>
      <p>
        It’s kind of the same of having the power to believe but instead you put these thoughts to action. It’s easier to imagine a goal, but it’s harder to put action into that goal. Motivation is key, but also the power of enjoying what you want to achieve is bigger.
        If we can mentally practice coding for example, if we think about how we want to function something, our imagination of mentally coding will impact the act of coding. And this can benefit you with anything you want to achieve.
      <p>
     <h2>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit:</h2>
     <p>
      Like learning you have to learn, you have to give it the time and day, practice, practice and practice. But of course knowing your limits of how to manage yourself is important. You don’t want to fatigue your brain. Knowing the limits will help cause a healthier brain growth.
     </p>

      <h2>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>
      <p>
        Practice, practice and practice. A repetitive learning style is usually best. But to know that it takes time is when it becomes easier. For example I’ve been learning to make music and songs, but this required repetitive action for about two years (how long I've been practicing). I’d usually attempt making a song at least once - twice a week. Sometimes everyday. But if I were to look about two years ago to today, my music making has gotten so much better.

        Someone in our cohort (I forgot who as I couldn’t find it on discord again) but they linked this and I always think about it now.

         I haven’t particularly practiced it yet but it’s really good to know about. It uses the idea of spaced repetition to counter the decay of our memory.

       <h1 class="growthTitle">Growth Mindset</h1>

       <h2>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant:</h2>

       <p>
        A growth mindset is the ability to keep on trying. To be able to accept that some things are challenging and that you can take them on. There’s the opposite of a growth mindset which is a; fixed mindset. With a fixed mindset it’s usually just thinking you can’t do it and that there is an easier way around it. But usually there never is and taking on the challenge and heading straight into is a growth mindset. Because by taking on the challenge you have the ability to believe you can do it. With a growth mindset teaching has to be encouraging. Like encouraging a student that they're doing it, that they're on the right track, and award their process rather than their final result.
       </p>

       <h2>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h2>

       <p>
        Not really, I think it’s surprising that many schools haven’t taken on this approach. Maybe traditional teaching won’t really change much, possibly because integrating this style would be hard. But I’ve always been surrounded by people with a growth mindset, so I thought it was normal. But it’s really motivating to be around. I think for me this was a reminder because sometimes you can’t help but get stuck in a fixed mindset.
       </p>

       <h2>How will you integrate a growth mindset into your learning journey?</h2>

      <p>
        
       Mindfulness practices will be a good approach to integrating a growth mindset, but also just encouraging others and reminding yourself to encourage yourself will help the journey. By taking on the challenges day by day, and trying them out as best as you can. JS was a big challenge and I received help from others and that’s encouraging a growth mindset. Trying not to isolate yourself to try to take on things by yourself is easier to get trapped into.

      <h2>Further Reflection:</h2>
      <p>
        What I’ve noticed so far with coding and on this journey is that it does require plenty of attention. Our learning is somewhat fast-paced and crammed week by week with information. But this has made learning somewhat easier as well as harder. It is easier because you see and feel the outcome. I am able to jump in a terminal, make a folder, make some files, open up a code editor and create a webpage with some basic HTML, I can add styling with basic CSS. All this by muscle memory by repeating what we’ve been taught. Heck I can push and pull from github. I think this style of learning has slowly integrated into my practice day by day. My learning plan has only been updated because of this awareness of a Growth Mindset and getting an understanding of how the brain functions and how we as people can learn almost anything. It will influence me to do more, I feel I have already been pushing myself to do more since I have started this course.
