     <h2>Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values:</h2>
     <p>
      I think values are what stem from your past, I think your past builds your future self. Who you are determines the self of today; in this very moment. Look back only a week ago where you were, who you were, what were you doing and how were you doing. If I reflect on myself from a week ago which would be last Friday (17th, June 2022). What was I doing, really I was doing nothing with myself, I voluntarily left my bar job about a month before.

      <p>
      Over the last four years since I left highschool I went straight to Elam School of Fine Arts at the University of Auckland. I wasn’t necessarily good at generic subjects such as English, Math or 
      Science. It didn’t mean I don't enjoy them, I tried to do my best in each of those subjects though Art making was the easiest subject for me to flow through. I didn’t have the stress of studying like I did with generic subjects. Art at school was comforting, as I could flow through it because I enjoyed it. I enjoyed the ideas and concepts of English and Math, but it was hard and that made it hard to enjoy doing. I guess this suggests a certain value of myself, that taking on the things I enjoy doing and pursuing them. I wouldn’t say that Art School was a breeze or Art at high school too. It was all hard but I think it was the enjoyment that counted and that’s why I kept doing it. 
      </p>
      
      
      <p>
      Though this is where I could stem where some values of mine come from. Art School was an environment where I could physically do things, but at the same time mentally learn new things too. Putting those two things together is a value of mine, learning and action. Acting on the things you learn are so enjoyable to me. But I think an underlying component would be to ask the question why I was doing what I was doing. Certain people see a future for themselves and that can be due to many things. But for some reason I never did, so once I gained a slight conscience for what I enjoyed, I pursued it. Maybe it’s because coming from nothing all you can think is nothing, maybe that was just the era I was in, and maybe I just didn’t want to be like my parents who’d work jobs that they didn’t enjoy. I feel stubborn for saying that but that’s what I knew I didn’t want to do. A goal that’s always in the back of mind is to hopefully give my parents a peace of mind, so they don’t have to do that any more. I suppose a deep value of mine is family, and maybe that I don’t need to always mention that because I know it’s always deep down and that it’s held to me. So I began to build values for myself. Values such as, does this work for me? Is this what I want? Do I have to do this? It may seem stubborn but it usually works, I may encounter problems on the way but who doesn’t?

     <h2>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity:</h2>
      <p>
        My family background influences me the way it has today, where I am now would be because of this. It is now that I have all these friends, that I learn the same ideas and values from. It forms a main overarching value of connection to friends and family. Though it links back to my culture I consider today that is influenced from my past. As if my culture was cumulative by my family, their beliefs and interests impacted mine today. My today may be very different to what my family thinks theirs is but it all stems from them.

     <h2>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development:</h2>
      <p>
        My strengths and limitations would possibly be that I try new things and to take on the challenges it gives me. I think the limitations would be consistency, patience, focus and the ability to keep trying. Though in saying I still practice each of these limitations by still attempting them. So I usually don’t give up on certain things. One thing I believe (which may need to change) in general, is to not stress myself out and not let time be the factor of diminishing my ability to do. I try to tell myself “there’s heaps of time” and that you can always come back to challenges. And the strength of trying is always the best for me and I believe will be helpful along the journey. Being able to get something wrong is a strength and being able to step back from it, to then come back to is a way over the obstacle of the problem. How do you think you can solve something without trying it and leaving it alone forever.

     <h2>
      Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others:</h2>
      <!-- <h3></h3> -->
        <p>
          An example of times I’ve worked collaboratively with others would be being a part of an artist run gallery. We host artists to exhibit their work. Our practice when introducing an artist, is learning about their work before exhibiting, by having a sit down with everyone and the artist themselves. This allows us to listen to them, what they have to say about their work and why they're showing it. It also allows us to reflect on our own ideas, our own questions about their work. Being able to open up a discussion with one another while the artist is there. It works well because a certain number of people are present and we get to ask questions we are unsure of, like “why this artwork and not another”. Engaging and challenging ourselves with the artist and the gallery, it gives a better understanding of anything asked related to the situation. Because then we have a comfortable understanding of what and why this is happening. Being able to open up to things we don’t understand when we find it hard to ask the question is always the best thing. It builds confidence with one another and ourselves. 
       </p>

      <h2>Overall Reflection:</h2>
      <p>
        I think having confidence is a big factor, you really have to push yourself in one way or another. For example interacting with strangers in DEVs is hard at first but once you do you slowly gain a rhythm. And realize it’s not too bad after all. That initial pushing through thoughts like “this is gonna sound silly” or “people are going to think I’m dumb”. Usually this is never the case. I don't think I’ve ever encountered that to this day, people are always helpful when you ask for help. Following some of the strategies being introduced through Sprint 1, have been effective and I am slowly introducing them into practice. The example of interacting with strangers I feel was a strategy I have learnt from Devs. Also opening up about myself, these questions about Identity, Values and Strengths. I don’t think I have ever asked myself or even attempted to answer but now I somewhat have, though I believe I am still practicing this and can develop it more over time.
