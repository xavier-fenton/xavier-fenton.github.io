     <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
     
     <p>
      Emotional Intelligence is being consciously aware of oneself. The ability to be aware of your own actions either that being, when you become happy, what makes you happy and how does it make you happy? It can apply to any emotion, even being angry and how do you know that you are. How do you regulate yourself when feeling this particular way? It’s really about being aware of what's happening within yourself, and how you relate that to your world, or situations. Becoming present in the moment. 
      This also applies to how you feel towards others, and how you react to them. Our reaction should be clear and responsive,we should be adaptive to ourselves and others in any particular situation.
      The ability to be able to experience the moment with a non-judgmental reaction, simply being able to notice.

      <h2>How is it different from IQ? </h2>
      <p>
        IQ is like being technically sound in what you can do, like being good at HTML or CSS. But doesn’t necessarily mean you are attuned with being Emotionally Intelligent. With IQ you can be great at something, but are you great at teaching your practice to others, are you great at sharing what you know with others, without it being a pain to do so. 
      <p>
     <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
     <p>
      If you feel that you’re better at something like coding then someone else then, you’re not really creating an open environment of your practice. Coding is something anyone can learn, and I have said that to many people, it’s really about being determined, it’s really hard for myself to learn but I am doing it. And I like to share that with people. Being able to distinguish what you are doing is hard, but you are determined to do it.  If you are able to share to someone about tackling a difficult task in a matter which makes them feel comfortable, you engage them to really be motivated to complete it. Like the saying “If you can do it, I can do it”. But flipping it: “If I can do it, you can definitely do it”. Emotional Intelligence is important because of the motivation you may offer to others.
