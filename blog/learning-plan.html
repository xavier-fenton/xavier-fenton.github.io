          <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
          <p>
            Honestly it hasn't changed much compared to my foundations learning plan. But I do want to have more of a learning journey, where I can keep developing my skills and trying out new things when it comes to programming. I wanna keep active in the programming sector of the industry. Continue to keep developing and growing.
        
          </p>
          <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>
            <p>
              Keeping up with JavaScript is going to be hard, the time it took to do the foundations only makes me wonder how intense it will be in boot camp. Though I think also keeping up with every other language we have learnt too. I need not to isolate one language, I should always think about how I can apply the problems I face with other languages too. If that's formating or visual coding layouts and so on.
           
            </p>
        

        
          <h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
            <p>
              Possibly keeping up with my health, but also keeping up with others. Being able to manage both will be a challenge, but it will be a growth thing and being able to intergrate it into my life style. I am looking forward to it though.  
          
          </p>
        

        
          <h2>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
            <p>
              I really want to utilise working with others well, and I really hope this will show over time. Because noticing in foundations how great it is to work with people, has a big effect on my learning style and overall feeling about what I do. So being able to have great communication and creating good work enviroments is what I want to be able to develop.
         
            </p>
            
          <h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
          <p>
            I think knowing that DEV has a specific way of teaching and facilitating learning, with the combining of core and. I feel it's a comfortable way of teaching which I enjoy. I respect though that this also relfects on the way we will have to work alongside the facilitators, we have to show the same effort towards them that they do for us. 
          </p>
          <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h2>
          <p>
            As of now I am not so sure, but I expect myself to be prepared and be aware of how crazy this next 9 weeks may be. I am nervous but also excited, I just hope to make sure I take care of myself as well as others around me. 
            I'll definitley be asking for help when needed from facilitators and my working peers, and try my hardest to stay engaged as much as I can. By making sure everyone around me is comfortable and constantly checking in with one another. Just being able to create a nice working enviorment, but also knowing that there is gonna be hard times and real good times too.

            <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
            <p>
              A long term goal of mine is essentially, finding a stable job. Though I am interested in freelancing for friends and other odd jobs here and there. I’d like to build my skills overtime. It would be good to be able to be part of a company, say something commercial. Where this could act as my main placement, and on the side I am able to work on other things which align my interest. I’ve always found I create more when I have more of my time set-up. Doing more creative work in the spare time, I find this to be more of a need to push me to think more, to widen my ability of work. Sort of an escape but not, sometimes the feeling of being “stuck somewhere” gives me the motivation to do what I would like, and really go for it.
            </p>
            <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning:</h2>
              <p>
              Learning can be really hard. Some things you can engage with more than others. Sometimes you like the more practicalities like moving stuff around with CSS, but then your structuring of HTML with classes and identifying them can be hard to navigate. So I think this aligns with planning, and that my planning skills are not very well managed. This can be seen as a limitation, though at the same time I am able to learn from that, allowing me to stand back and really think about “how will I do this better for myself next time?”. I am slowly gaining strengths in finding my own limitations and weaknesses. I can’t really step far away from problems, I have to really act on fixing them. Which sometimes can be time consuming, I really have to find a good time management base for myself.
              </p>
          
  
          
            <h2>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
              <p>
              I am really trying to engage more with the cohort, and keep chatting with my home group and the channels in the foundations discord. As of lately I have really been thinking about trying to ask for more help, and it’s really nice to hear that everyone is there to help. And reaching out is a perfect solution to problems you can’t tackle on your own. I hope my communicative skills develop too. Because sometimes I find it difficult to explain myself clearer, without being too vague. It’s something I notice in myself and I am still learning how to do this better, and I think I just have to keep trying and build a habit of communicating more with the cohort.
            </p>
          
  
          
            <h2>
              A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h2>
              <h3>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives:</h3>
                <p>
                I think knowing your strengths and limitations comes along with working alongside others, getting to know who you’re working with and how you take on their workflows and personalities. To be able to work with others comfortably makes life that much more clear and functioning. Able to take on your own responsibilities and especially others, because really you can’t think about yourself too much in these situations, you have to be sure everyone else around you is happy and clear on how things are going. It’s a part of you to make sure that others feel you are contributing as much as them and for them.
              </p>
  
              <h3>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you:</h3>
              <p>
              Step back, clear the mind, body and soul. Ask for help to make sure that the others around you know what is happening, communication is key. 
              </p>
          
  
          
              <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way:</h2>
              <p>
              When I am feeling really stuck, I am slowly engaging more when I need help. Sometimes I stop myself from asking, because I feel it’s a problem I can solve and I always don’t want to seem silly, or as if I am asking a silly question, I am slowly starting not to think this way and just ask.
              </p>
          
  
          
            <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team:</h2>
              <p>
              So far the whole facilitation team has been so helpful, I haven’t seen no-one be “not engaged” with everyone, and it’s really comforting to know. It’s really cool to see the whole cohort being real engaged with one another too. The Dev team has helpful feedback and I really appreciate it.
            </p>
          
  
          
            <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h2>
            <p>
              I am trying to treat this as a real job, working Monday to Friday with a goal of 6-8 hours a day. I don’t really have any other commitments as of now and the next few months. Though If I do I just schedule other needs to the end of my days, because usually they're not as important.
