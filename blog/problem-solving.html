        <h1>Problem-Solving</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</h2>
        <h3>1. Were blocked on a simple problem:</h3>
        <p>
          I was trying to join a set of words together (a string), so it it could look like this (hellohellohello) instead of ('hello ', 'hello', ...). So i was just writing out the function in the wrong place I should have just been returning my function that I was creating. 
          <br>
          <br>
          I tried googling countless times but just kept going down paths of unrelated code methods. But when you can't fully solve a problem because you sat there for a bit too long. Reaching out for another pair of eyes really helps.
          <br>
          <br>
          It seems to be usually the simpliest things that make parts of coding that much harder. All it took was a friend to say "Hey you got it in the wrong place".
          <br>
          <br>
          I think I learn more from people when they see something I was close at getting but just further explaining why, because they give you a simplier expanation, because it reflects the way they solved the same problem.


    
          
        </p>
        
        <h2>2. Elegantly solved a problem</h2>
            <p>
              With FizzBuzz for returning numbers I found using the modulus operator to flow once I got an understanding of it. The numbers were given to me as the answer basically. Because I googled the definition of it, I could use it to say "if this number equal to this return num". Therefore I could use this for the next numbers that the question was asking. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Somethings just work easier visually, I can't really explain why. I reference in another blog entry about how thinking of JS as connecting the dots really helps out. An essentially this was the case, but not all the time does this workout. Again google is really helpful for getting closer to your answer. :''D
              
            <p>
        <h2> Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h2>
          <p>
            Sometimes I find myself getting up from the computer and walking back and forth asking myself the question over and over. I think I'd get it, sit down and bash in something but I can gamble and I get an inch closer but still not right.
            I think I work best with a second pair of eyes. In all cases when I have a friend workover it with me, they just point to little things I code do extra. It helps me understand in plain English the basis of my problems. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Some problems are the worst for instance TYPOs. I hate typo's because it can be one character out of place or a word and it can screw over a whole problem. So again a second pair of eyes just to notice something that was starring at for hours can instantly see the typo because it hadn't blended in to their mind like it did for me.
            <br>
            <br>
            Overall reflecting on the methods used for problem solving so far asking peers for help and the coaches has made my approach for programming much more confident about my future as becoming a developer. I feel somewhat at ease knowing that you don't always have to count on being alone when solving problems. That there is always others that a willing to help, and I hope I can be counted on too in the future. I'd want to be able to reuse these methods and guide others too as I find them incredibly helpful.
