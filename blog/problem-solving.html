        <br>

        <h2>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</h2>
        <h3>1. Were blocked on a simple problem:</h3>
        <p>
          I was trying to join a set of words together (a string), so it it could look like this (hellohellohello) instead of ('hello ', 'hello', ...). So i was just writing out the function in the wrong place I should have just been returning my function that I was creating. 
          <br>
          <br>
          I tried googling countless times but just kept going down paths of unrelated code methods. But when you can't fully solve a problem because you sat there for a bit too long. Reaching out for another pair of eyes really helps.
          <br>
          <br>
          It seems to be usually the simpliest things that make parts of coding that much harder. All it took was a friend to say "Hey you got it in the wrong place".
          <br>
          <br>
          I think I learn more from people when they see something I was close at getting but just further explaining why, because they give you a simplier expanation, because it reflects the way they solved the same problem.


    
          
        </p>
        
        <h2>2. Elegantly solved a problem</h2>
            <p>
              With FizzBuzz for returning numbers I found using the modulus operator to flow once I got an understanding of it. The numbers were given to me as the answer basically. Because I googled the definition of it, I could use it to say "if this number equal to this return num". Therefore I could use this for the next numbers that the question was asking. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Somethings just work easier visually, I can't really explain why. I reference in another blog entry about how thinking of JS as connecting the dots really helps out. An essentially this was the case, but not all the time does this workout. Again google is really helpful for getting closer to your answer. :''D
              
            <p>
        <h2> Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h2>
          <p>
            Sometimes I find myself getting up from the computer and walking back and forth asking myself the question over and over. I think I'd get it, sit down and bash in something but I can gamble and I get an inch closer but still not right.
            I think I work best with a second pair of eyes. In all cases when I have a friend workover it with me, they just point to little things I code do extra. It helps me understand in plain English the basis of my problems. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Some problems are the worst for instance TYPOs. I hate typo's because it can be one character out of place or a word and it can screw over a whole problem. So again a second pair of eyes just to notice something that was starring at for hours can instantly see the typo because it hadn't blended in to their mind like it did for me.
            <br>

            <span> <strong> Overall reflecting on the methods used for problem solving:</strong></span>
            <br>
            <br>

            <span> <strong>Pseudocode:
            </strong></span>
            <br>
            <br>
            This is a great way of seeing how I need to write my code in plain English and also how I can attack it. I feel quite confident about psuedocode for my future in programming.
          

            <br>
            <br>

            <span> <strong>Trying something:</strong></span>
            <br>
            <br>
            I am confident in trying out my code, but not confident it will work 😂.

            <br>
            <br>
            <span> <strong>Rubber Ducky Method:</strong></span>
            <br>
            <br>
            This method is pretty funny and makes me feel some type of way my confidence with the rubber ducky will grow over time. As of now not too confident with the rubber ducky.

            <br>
            <br>
            <span> <strong>Reading error messages:</strong></span>
            <br>
            <br>
            I am pretty confident about error messages, I can understand where my error is in my code.

            <br>
            <br>
            <span> <strong>Console.logging</strong></span>
            <br>
            <br>
            This is what I need to do each time I create something new with JS, but I know how to use it so I am pretty comfortable with it, like it's becoming second nature to do.

            <br>
            <br>
            <span> <strong>Googling:</strong></span>
            <br>
            <br>
            Google is my best friend but somedays it doesn't wanna give me the right answer at all. I am quite confident with the use of Google though. Thanks Google.

            <br>
            <br>
            <span> <strong>Asking you peers for help:</strong></span>
            <br>
            <br>
            This is the best method so far for that always works. I have gain so much confidence in asking peers for help.

            <br>
            <br>
            <span> <strong>Asking coaches for help:</strong></span>
            <br>
            <br>
            This is still tricky to do because I don't want to feel like I am annoying the facilitators or not feeling as if I am showing them I am learning. Because it's a pretty overwhelming process programming. And I feel like sometimes I shutdown or  feel as if I just lost all my memory about coding.

            <br>
            <br>
            <span> <strong>Improving your process with reflection:</strong></span>
            <br>
            <br>
            I am confident about reflecting because I think this gives me somewhat of a third person prespective on myself and my learning. I can really stand back and clear my thinking. But also it helps me improve overall and identify what I need to do to overcome certain things.
