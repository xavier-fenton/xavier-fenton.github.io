     <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
      <h3>1.Finding out more about myself:</h3>
     <p>
      With starting out core I was answering questions I never really thought about. And this was good, it probably felt the most challenging and confusing. Because sure I do feel some of these core question I have thought about before but never so indepth. I had to really think deeply and look more within myself. And understand why I do certain things and why. I was confused because I could think that some of these certain ideas I have about myself will definitely change over time. So I'd think why bother thinking about it.
      <br>
      <br>
      Though I think most importantly is being self-aware of myself. I have gradually thought more about what I do and why I do things. If there is a problem I think more about it now, I can't just shrug it off I have to make mends with it. 
      
     </p>
     <h3>2. Some ego lost:</h3>
     <p>
      With somethings it's hard not think you're good at it. But with coding it's a whole new world for me. There has been times where I definitely feel as if I know nothing, which in some ways are true. But I am learning and just started about 5 weeks ago. Managing that voice in your head is crucial, and I feel with practicing core it helps with the processing of such challenging thoughts. Becuase sometimes your ego can get the best of you, and you need to over come it in some situations. Build the confidence you need to push through and move on.

     </p>
     <h3>3. How to structure my learning:</h3>
        <p>
          This has probably been one of the most important things for me to have learnt. When starting this course I didn't really know how to structure my learning very well. In the first couple weeks I had to stay up all night and just get everything done. But slowly over time this was wearing me down. So I had to step back and find a solution for my self. With structuring and planning my time and learning was a way I really found I worked best. I'd treat this like a job, I'd start at a certain time and finish at a certain time. This I found best because it never wore me down, when I stopped working I'd do whatever I pleased and wouldn't think about work (as much as I could). This allowed my mind to relax and refresh for the next day. I found I was more energised and up for the challenges. Rather than coming at them with a tired worn down mind. Core helped me take care of myself through each sprint.

        </p>
     
      <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming? </h2>
      <p>
        You have to have certain values that agree with other peoples values too. I think knowing that programming isn't a "who can do it best" or a competition is a big thing that I've learnt. Coding should be about being an open and comforting practice to everyone who is wanting to learn programming, it's a big value that should be learnt. I am still learning about expressing this value and always thinking about it. And it goes along with empathy too, you can't put someone down for not being able to do what you can do. You have to be encouraging, and I say this with experience because everyone in this course has been very encouraging to me as I learn. Because I truely don't know too much myself and I can't take for granted all the help I've been given. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Self-awareness is one of the most important values you should be able to hold. I think it's definitely something that isn't mastered but rather and on going learning journey about oneself. Nobody is perfect, but being able to identify problems within yourself will be a big value over time. Because it can also be applied to how you identify problems in your code, or maybe the way you have handle a situation while working with peers. It's about being able to learn from what you have done, if you can do it differently, how would you? There are many ways of awareness, but practicing them is most important. 
        
      <p>
     <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
          I think becoming more aware of certain core aspects, and the noticing change when practicing them. That it really takes time too, to learn all this core and practice you really have to put in as much effort as you do for when you programme maybe even more. It is a hard thing to do, you may think it's simple but its really not!
      
        </p>
     <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
     <p>
      Practicing core I find quite challenging you have to be aware of what you do a lot, it like learning a new skill but you really want to master it so you try a lot. And it can be full on and take a lot of energy.
      
     </p>
     <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
     <p>
      I don't think anyone really want's to work with someone who is intentionally bad with people. I say that because some people do find it naturally hard to work with others and can't express that or verbalise it. But for some reason there are people out there who really hate it, and I find that hard to believe but it is what it is. I think DEV takes core seriously because it helps you work with all kinds of people, helps you build good relationships and you give some much to an employer with great core skills.
     </p>
     <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
     <p>
      No, I don't think it has been a waste of time at all. I've learnt a lot about myself, and imagine if I just went on coding. I would have just been coding into some sort of abyss. I feel I need to be able to know how I am working, how I feel, what feels right or wrong. Rather than code like a robot with no intention or feeling. I think it's really good too have great intention behind the things you do, because I think it will really show through some of your projects or person when doing things.
